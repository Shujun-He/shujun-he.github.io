I"E<p>Neural networks may seem mysterious to most people, and thus theirs capabilities are often overestimated. However, in truth, any neural network is just a combination of elementary mathematical operations and in turn, a computational graph. In this post, I am going to show you to how to build a simple neural network with two layers and the math behind it. Part I here is <strong>the math</strong> and part II will be <strong>the code</strong>.</p>

<p>As can be seen above, the neural network is a graph that consists of vertices and edges. To put it simply, we can consider the states of the neural network (input, hidden state, and output) as vertices; the intermediate math operations can then be considered the edges of the graph (in red and blue in the graph above).</p>
