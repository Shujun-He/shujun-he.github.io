I"à<p>Neural networks may seem mysterious to most people, and thus theirs capabilities are often overestimated. However, in truth, any neural network is just a combination of elementary mathematical operations and in turn, a computational graph. In this post, I am going to show you to how to build a simple neural network with two layers and the math behind it. Part I here is <strong>the math</strong> and part II will be <strong>the code</strong>.</p>

<p>You may have heard people talk about neurons in neural networks, and it is a pretty neat way of describing dot products with non-linear transforms but that is not how we will look at our neural network. As can be seen above, the neural network is a graph that consists of vertices and edges. To put it simply, we can consider the states of the neural network (input, hidden state, and output) as vertices; the intermediate math operations can then be considered the edges of the graph (in red and blue in the graph above). So overall, we have two types of edges:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fully connected layers</li>
  <li>Activations</li>
</ul>
