<p>A combination of a parallel electric field and pressure gradient can cause DNA molecules
to migrate transverse to the field lines. We hypothesize that the phenomenon is due to an
electrically induced velocity disturbance. A Brownian dynamics method for a bead-spring
model of a polymer, that incorporates this electrically induced velocity disturbance, was
constructed and used to predict the dynamics of DNA molecules transported through a
microfluidic channel due to the pressure driven flow and electric field. Using simulation,
we obtained the probability distribution of the centers-of-mass of the DNA molecules in
multiple channels with different cross-sectional dimensions. Preliminary simulation results
match, at least qualitatively, the extent of migration and the entry length measured in the
experiments.</p>
