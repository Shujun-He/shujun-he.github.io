I"¢<p><em>The simplest picture one can form about the creation of an emperical science is along the lines of an inductive method.
Individual facts are selected and grouped together so that the laws that connect them become apparentâ€¦However, the bigh advances
in scientific knowledge originated in this way only to a small degreeâ€¦The truly great advances in our understanding of nature originated
in a way almost diametrically opposed to induction. The intuitive grasp of the essentials of a large complex of fatcs leads the scientist
to the postulation of a hypothetical basic law or laws. From these laws, he derives his conclusions.</em></p>
