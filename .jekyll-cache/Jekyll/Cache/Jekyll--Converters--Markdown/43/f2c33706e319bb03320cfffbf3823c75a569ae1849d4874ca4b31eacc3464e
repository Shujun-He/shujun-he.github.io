<p><em>The simplest picture one can form about the creation of an emperical science is along the lines of an inductive method.
Individual facts are selected and grouped together so that the laws that connect them become apparentâ€¦However, the big advances
in scientific knowledge originated in this way only to a small degreeâ€¦The truly great advances in our understanding of nature originated
in a way almost diametrically opposed to induction. The intuitive grasp of the essentials of a large complex of fatcs leads the scientist
to the postulation of a hypothetical basic law or laws. From these laws, he derives his conclusions.</em></p>

      <h2><a href="/simple-nn-part1/">A simple two-layered neural network from scratch in python: Part I, forward-propagation and the computational graph</a></h2>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Neural networks may seem mysterious to most people, and thus theirs capabilities are often overestimated. However, in truth, any neural network is just a combination of elementary mathematical operations and in turn, a computational graph. In this post, I am going to show you to how to build a simple neural network with two layers for a classification problem and the math behind it. Part I here is about <strong>forward-propagation</strong> and <strong>the computational graph</strong>.</p>

      <h2><a href="/50PiP-40/">How many cards until an ace appears? A Monte Carlo Approach</a></h2>

      <div class="entry">
        <p>Today we are going to look at Problem 40 from the book 50 Challenging Problems in Probability by Frederick Mosteller. However, instead of solving it analytically, we are going to use the Monte Carlo method (random sampling) to solve it.</p>

<p>The problem goes like this:</p>

<p><em>Shuffle an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards containing four aces.
Then turn up cards from the top until the first ace appears. On the average, how many cards are required to produce the first ace?</em></p>

      <h2><a href="/DNA-migration-thesis/">Migration of DNA Due to a Combination of Parallel Pressure Gradient and External Electric Field</a></h2>

      <div class="entry">
        <p><img src="/images/dna_migration.jpg" alt="dna" /></p>

<p>A combination of a parallel electric field and pressure gradient can cause DNA molecules
to migrate transverse to the field lines. We hypothesize that the phenomenon is due to an
electrically induced velocity disturbance. A Brownian dynamics method for a bead-spring
model of a polymer, that incorporates this electrically induced velocity disturbance, was
constructed and used to predict the dynamics of DNA molecules transported through a
microfluidic channel due to the pressure driven flow and electric field. Using simulation,
we obtained the probability distribution of the centers-of-mass of the DNA molecules in
multiple channels with different cross-sectional dimensions. Preliminary simulation results
match, at least qualitatively, the extent of migration and the entry length measured in the
experiments.</p>
