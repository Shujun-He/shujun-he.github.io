I"<p>Neural networks may seem mysterious to most people, and thus theirs capabilities are often overestimated. However, in truth, any neural network is just a combination of elementary mathematical operations and in turn, a computational graph. In this post, I am going to show you to how to build a simple neural network with two layers for a classification problem and the math behind it. Part I here is about <strong>forward-propagation</strong> and <strong>the computational graph</strong>.</p>
