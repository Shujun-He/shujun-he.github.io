Hi! My name is Shujun He. I am currently a PhD student in chemical engineering at the Texas A&M University. 

# What I do

Things I have worked on include coarse-grained DNA simulations, computational protein design, molecular dynamics, computational toxicology, and deep learning. By definition, I am
a chemical engineer with a focus in computations.
