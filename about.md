Hi! My name is Shujun He. I am currently a grad student in chemical engineering at the Texas A&M University. You can check out my [CV](https://github.com/Shujun-He/shujun-he.github.io/raw/master/cv_4.pdf)

# What I do

Things I have worked on include coarse-grained DNA simulations, computational protein design, molecular dynamics, computational toxicology, and deep learning. By definition, I am
a chemical engineer with a focus in computations. You can check out my publications on google scholar: [Shujun's google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fMCd1LcAAAAJ&hl=en))
