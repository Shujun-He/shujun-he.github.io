*The simplest picture one can form about the creation of an emperical science is along the lines of an inductive method.
Individual facts are selected and grouped together so that the laws that connect them become apparent...However, the big advances
in scientific knowledge originated in this way only to a small degree...The truly great advances in our understanding of nature originated
in a way almost diametrically opposed to induction. The intuitive grasp of the essentials of a large complex of fatcs leads the scientist
to the postulation of a hypothetical basic law or laws. From these laws, he derives his conclusions.*

-Albert Einstein

Hi! My name is Shujun He. I am currently a PhD student in chemical engineering at Texas A&M University. 
Things I have worked on include coarse-grained DNA simulations, 
computational protein design, molecular dynamics, and computational toxicology.

This is my personal website, where I share some of my private work, involving programming and deep learning,
and my personal insights on the world.
